### Pull Request Process

We follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** the project to your machine.
3.  Create a **new branch** for your changes:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b name-of-your-feature-or-fix
    ```
4.  Make your changes, and **commit** them with a clear, descriptive commit message. We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. For example:
    - `feat: Add file creation button to sidebar`
    - `fix: Correctly handle file saving on Windows`

    git push origin name-of-your-feature-or-fix
    ```
6.  Open a **Pull Request** from your forked repository to the main pyNote repository.
7.  In the Pull Request description, link to any relevant issues (e.g., "Closes #123") and provide a clear summary of your changes.

Once you've submitted your Pull Request, a project maintainer will review it. We may ask for changes or improvements. We'll do our best to provide timely and constructive feedback!
